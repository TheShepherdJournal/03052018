<p><i>From Jay Gross:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyone have a rough day Friday?</p>
<p>I bet a few did...</p>
<p>Another tragic event we were forced to endure so very, very close to home...</p>
<p>And I watched and read the comments and posts... the barrage of negativity that followed...</p>
<p>Yes. I lurked...</p>
<p>And Saturday morning I watched a sunrise... for just a bit longer...</p>
<p>And know what popped into my head? Life will go on. Because we will not quit.</p>
<p>Quitting is a disease... a terminal one. It becomes addicting. Do it once, and it gets easier and easier... and it begins to snowball into everything in our lives... from relationships to sports to jobs to games to everything...</p>
<p>We. As Americans. As True Blue Jays Do. Not. Quit.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>We will continue to be kind. To be community. To be strong. To fight this disease of violence that has befallen our world... a world of secure modes. Lockdowns. Tragedies...</p>
<p>Because We. Do. Not. Quit.</p>
<p>True colors are exposed when life gets tough. See it is so very easy to be calm, cool, & collected when life is good. Easy. Going our way. Any one can sail on calm waters.</p>
<p>A true test of character. Of strength... of what we truly are is how we react when life gets hard... gets in our face... and tests us...</p>
<p>That is what truly defines us as people. As a person...</p>
<p>Life will NEVER define us as quitters.</p>
<p>True Blue Jays donâ€™t know how to quit.</p>
