Upon viewing a home movie of a very early Maple Syrup Festival parade I thought why not bring back some of the same look. This year is the <strong>60<sup>th</sup> Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival</strong>.  The parade is the feature event of the festival.  A goal for this year’s parade is to include more local involvement from non-profits.  The SMSF committee offers prize money for the three best float entries ($300 to $100).  <strong>This year the committee will help cover the cost of float building material (up to $200) to any non-profit.</strong>  The float must relate to this year’s theme. “Celebrate Sixty”.  To allow the parade coordinator to manage a parade budget, any non-profit must follow guidelines available from the parade coordinator.  Agreement to follow guide lines for reimbursement must be done April 14, 2018.

Secondly a non-profit may receive a payment for participation in the parade.  This may include wearing costumes, carrying parade signs, forming marching units or any other form of entertainment that the parade coordinator determines entertaining.
